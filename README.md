We will be launching the RSE Asia Association online on Thursday, 14th October 2021. This day holds special significance as it is being celebrated as the [International RSE Day](https://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html), for the first time!

At the launch event we will be conducting activities for contributing to [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) too. We hope to have you join us online at the launch event. The launch event is fully online. For further queries regarding our Hacktoberfest 2021 activities, please contact Jyoti Bhogal at bhogaljyoti1@gmail.com.

The RSE Asia Association is being built as a project under the [Open Life Science program (OLS-4)](https://openlifesci.org/ols-4/projects-participants/#). 

We follow the Code of Conduct of the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/).
