The RSE Asia Association was launched during a project under the [Open Life Science Cohort-4 programme (OLS-4)](https://openlifesci.org/ols-4/projects-participants/#) programme by [Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal](https://saranjeetkaur.github.io/About-Me/) and [Jyoti Bhogal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyoti-bhogal-a20705163/), under the Mentorship of [Anne Fouilloux](https://github.com/annefou). It was launched on Thursday, 14th October 2021, which is also the first [International RSE Day](https://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html). At the launch event we conducted activities for contributing to [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Both Saranjeet and Jyoti graduated from the OLS-4 during early 2022 (graduation certificates below).
