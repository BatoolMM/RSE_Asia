This is a joint partnership between the newly formed RSE Asia Association and the RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand.\nWe would like to thank our Key partners ARDC and QCIF for supporting us, as well as our Accessibility partner, the Society for Research Software Engineering, and our Allied partners, NCI Australia and Google Cloud for researchers.\nA copy of our report is available at “Mosbergen, Rowland (2022): Research Software Engineer Asia Australia Unconference Summary Report. figshare. Online resource. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21201989”. This includes an accessible report in Microsoft Word format.\nCheck the video playlist with our keynotes and panel discussion https://tinyurl.com/RSEAA2022-videos.\n\n\nWhat is a Research Software Engineer?\nResearch Software Engineer is a broad term for people who combine programming and research skills that have trouble defining their role and value within academia. e.g researchers and academics who code, generalists who bring communities together across the research and technical domains, systems administrators who maintain research systems, and software engineers who work in the research domain.\nWhy participate?\nThis will be run as a participant-first online unconference to ensure you have a say on how we develop the community and to allow you to share your valuable technical and social knowledge of research software with the community. In line with that, the theme for this year’s unconference is “Building community”.\nTogether, we can create a sustainable community that benefits research software engineers by raising recognition and building career paths for RSEs, and ultimately contributes to more efficient and reproducible research.\nWe also hope that this experience will identify ways to positively engage with senior leaders who are working on policies that directly affect you and the rest of the RSE community.\nRegister here (This registration is closed now.)\nWhat is an unconference?\nThe unconference will run online over three half-days from 13:00 to 17:00 AEST on 14, 15 and 16 of September. An unconference is where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space [1].\nFor this particular unconference, we will create breakout groups for the top three topics for each session. At the start of each day we will have an introduction session to provide the participants with some ideas on what they might want to discuss during the conference. We aim to summarise topics and make these available publicly after the unconference.\nAn overview of what the program will look like is below.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference\nDraft Programme\nAll times in UTC+10\n\nDay 1 - 14th September\nDay 2 - 15th September\nDay 3 - 16th September\n1:00PM - 1:30PM\nWelcome, Vision, Explanation, and Partners\nExplain, Review\nExplain, Review\n1:30PM - 2:00PM\nEarly Career RSE keynote\nMid Career RSE keynote\nStrategy & Policy Panel\n2:00PM - 2:30PM\nIntroductions to connect\nSecond Session\nStrategy & Policy Panel\n2:30PM - 3:00PM\nIntroductions to connect\nSecond Session\nStrategy & Policy Panel\n3:00PM - 3:30PM\nBreak\nBreak\nBreak\n3:30PM - 4:00PM\nFirst Session\nThird Session\nActionable items\n4:00PM - 4:30PM\nFirst Session\nThird Session\nActionable items\n4:30PM - 5:00PM\nEarly Career RSE keynote\nReview and discussion\nClose and thank you\nFlyers\nPanel RSE Asia Australia conference 2022 - building the research software community across Asia and AustraliaKeynotes of RSE Asia Australia conference 2022 - building the research software community across Asia and AustraliaKey Dates\nSAVE the dates! 14th to the 16th of September 2022 13:00 to 17:00 AEST\nMonday 27th June 2022: Registration opens\nMonday 15th August 2022: Deadline for accessibility grants\nWednesday 31st August 2022: Deadline for applying to scholarship\nWednesday 7th September 2022: Registration closes\nTuesday 13th September 2022: Optional Local Hub meetups in person\nWednesday 14th September 2022: Start of unconference, Junior RSE Keynote\nThursday 15th September 2022: Senior RSE Keynote\nFriday 16th September 2022: End of unconference, RSE Strategy Policy Panel\nAll dates combined to an .ics file for your Calendar App: RSEAA2022.ics\nRegistration\nRegistration is now open here.\nRegistration will close on the 7th of September 2022.\nAccessibility and Inclusivity\nWe are committed to creating a safe, accessible, and inclusive environment for all participants.\nTo this end we are offering 50 scholarships for staff or students to participate for free, as well as a $50 AUD accessibility micro-grant to help with internet, headphones, childcare etc.\nEligibility for the scholarships will be based on prioritising and maximising the inclusion and participation of people who have been impacted due to the cumulative effects of discrimination on factors such as race, gender, disability, gender identity, financial status,and the intersectionality of that discrimination as well as others not mentioned here.\nEligibility for the accessibility micro-grants will be based on a similar approach.\nLiz Hare has provided a high-level accessibility report for the conference.\nHow to apply for the scholarship and accessibility micro-grant\nTo apply for the scholarship, please email us at rse2022 at rse-aunz dot org with the subject [Scholarship] and why you would like to attend for free and how this would benefit you and your organisation (200 words maximum).\nTo apply for the accessibility micro-grant, please email us at rse2022 at rse-aunz dot org with the subject [Accessibility] and why you would like a micro-grant, how would you use it and how attending would benefit you (200 words maximum).\nIf you are applying for both, please email us separately.\nWe encourage participants to apply even if they do not think they are eligible as this will allow us to prioritise and maximise diversity and inclusion. All information will be treated in a confidential manner.\nIf you feel that the unconference is not matching up to the commitment of these ideals, please let us know by contacting the organising committee at rse2022 at rse-aunz dot org.\nThe Code of Conduct is designed to provide all participants with community participation guidelines.\nPartner with us\nIf your organisation would like to partner with us, there are still Allied partnerships available.
