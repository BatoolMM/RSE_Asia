This was following my participation in the Collaborations Workshop 2025 organised by the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) at the University of Stirling. I was joined by SSI Fellows Samantha Wittke and Saranjeet Kaur.\nImage: (Left to Right) SSI Fellows: Saranjeet Kaur, Jyoti Bhogal, Samantha Wittke at EPCC, Bayes Center, University of Edinburgh against the backdrop of the Holyrood Park (Salisbury Crags on the left, Arthur‚Äôs Seat on the right). Image credit: Catherine Inglis.On the day, Catherine Inglis and Neil Chue Hong welcomed us to the Bayes Centre at EPCC. The robots on the ground floor of the Bayes Centre are hard to miss, and I must say, I was captivated by them! We all went on a tour of the EPCC building and met several members of the team there. Later, we stepped out and had a lunch break in the beautiful and sunny campus of the University of Edinburgh. It was during the chats with Catherine and Neil, I got to know that the Unicorn ü¶Ñ - an imaginary creature - is the National Animal of Scotland, and then it made sense to me why the buildings in Edinburgh have so many unicorn statues!\nImage: (Left to Right) A robot at the Bayes Center, University of Edinburgh; The Unicron, the National Animal of ScotlandThere were two talks planned for the day. The first one was by Samantha, who shared about the CodeRefinery project and her work with the Nordic RSE. Later, I presented my talk on the ongoing ‚ÄòResearch Study on the Research Software Engineering (RSEng) Landscape in Asia‚Äô. Coincidentally, there were a few common points touched during both the talks - maybe CodeRefinery and RSE Asia could collaborate more closely in the future, but for now, I will focus this blog on my talk! üòä\nImage: Jyoti Bhogal speaking about her ‚ÄúResearch Study on the Research Software Engineering (RSEng) Landscape in Asia‚Äù at EPCC, Bayes Center, University of Edinburgh.What is RSE Asia?\nWe (I and my co-Founder Saranjeet Kaur) launched the Research Software Engineering Asia Association (RSE Asia) back in 2021, on the very first International RSE Day, as there was almost no awareness about Research Software Engineering in the Asian region. Over the past 3+ years we have conducted and participated in various events and workshops to raise awareness about the profession and the community. Based on the reflections over this period, I started to explore the RSE landscape in the Asian region to get better informed insights.\nWhat is my project about?\nThe motivation for this project was gained after reflecting over several of the community initiatives and interactions that RSE Asia had with the community in the region. I was further encouraged to take this work ahead when I proposed the idea during my talk on ‚ÄòWhat is Research Software and Why Should we Think About its Sustainability?‚Äô at the 58th meeting of the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN58) during August 2024, which was attended by delegates from across Asia Pacific as well as the globe. I have been developing this idea since then, and have been encouraged and supported to do so by several RSE community members, SSI fellows, and community leaders.\nSpeaking of why this study is required - this study is essential for several reasons, some of which are the need to diversify and expand the research software landscape, attempt to address the lack of formal RSE roles in Asia, leverage international partnerships, and further build a supportive community within Asia.\nSSI has been conducting surveys to study the RSE landscape since 2018. However, there has been almost no representation of Asia in these surveys. This makes my research study even more essential.\nImage: RSEs in the world in 2018, originally shared in the blog What do we know about RSEs? Results from our international surveys.Within Asia, the Asia-Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) is an organisation that represents member institutions as well as it is a backbone network connecting member countries and regions to each other and to other international research and education networks. I am a member of APAN‚Äôs Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG). This working group engages in dialogue and activities to promote good open science practices within research roles/institutes in the Asia Pacific. RSE Asia has had a consistent voice and representation during the biannual APAN meetings as a part of this working group. Through these engagements we realised the common interests we share with the working group and their intentions to help support the objectives of RSE Asia. Asia being a very complex and diverse region both, culturally and economically, it is essential to have the support from an established working group like the APAN‚Äôs OSDWG so as to have a better understanding of the research software landscape in the region.\nImage: APAN Current Members (as of December 2024). Source of information for creating map: APAN website.So far in this project, I have been able to refine and adapt the existing SSI surveys to make them suitable for the Asian context. I have also launched a pilot survey with a small group in APAN‚Äôs OSDWG to gain first-hand feedback on the survey so far. Next, I plan to refine the survey further based on this feedback before launching the full survey to a larger group. If you are either a researcher based in Asia or have worked in the Asian region or collaborate with colleagues in Asia, then please watch the RSE Asia page for updates about my project and the survey - I would love to hear from you!\nüéâ Concluding the day\nAfter the talks, we spent some time discussing our work with the audience, which smoothly transitioned into EPCC‚Äôs ritual of ‚ÄòFriday Buns‚Äô. We discussed the challenges and way forward. Later that evening, I walked up the Calton hill (recommended by many) and got to see a 360¬∞ view of the city, the valleys, as well as the beautiful North Sea. Being a bright, sunny day, with the sun setting almost post 10 pm, I went for a walk to the Portobello Beach, and loved every bit of it!\nImage (Left to Right): Me against the backdrop of the National Monument of Scotland on the Calton Hill; The beautiful blues and browns of the Portobello Beach in Edinburgh.I sincerely want to thank Neil Chue Hong for inviting me to EPCC and to Catherine Inglis for all the hospitality she offered.

It spans over half of the world‚Äôs population, and its members are fundamental in the provision of high-speed network connectivity domestically and globally.\nAPAN has a number of working groups, one of which is the Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG). I became a member of this working group based on the common interest around developing the research software community and its importance in the research ecosystem.\nAPAN organises biannual meetings bringing together its members and other interested participants to review progress, demonstrate advances in technology and applications, and make plans for the future activities in the Asia Pacific. Over the past months, I got the chance to attend APAN58 and APAN59 meetings, online remotely and exchange knowledge with its stakeholders. In this blog, I am capturing my experiences of attending these meetings.\nAPAN58 Presentation ImageSource: APAN58 : Asia Pacific Open and Sharing Data WG, 27th August 2024, Part 1\nDuring the APAN58 meeting (August 2024), I had the opportunity to present my talk titled ‚ÄòWhat is Research Software and Why Should we Think About its Sustainability?‚Äô as part of the Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG) discussion session. Through my talk, I highlighted the importance of Research Software in the research ecosystem, explaining why it is necessary to think about its sustainability. I shared methods, tools, and best practices that can be utilised to improve the sustainability of research software, following up with the need and the benefits to include techniques for reproducibility in Research Software. Furthermore, I shared what software tools can be used to create, maintain, and share research software (Zenodo, GitHub, GitLab). I spoke about the different types of licenses that can be attached to the outputs of the research. This was followed by a summary of the journey of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association, which I co-founded and co-lead since its launch in 2021.\nüîë Talk Resources:\nSlides: Jyoti Bhogal.

For the OSDWG session, which focused on topics like Open Science and how research software complements it, my presentation actually gave a keynote kind of a head start to the rest of the talks being presented in the session of OSDWG.\nSource: APAN58 : Asia Pacific Open and Sharing Data WG, 27th August 2024, Part 1\nTowards the end of my talk, I asked the audience to share their feedback to the questions ‚ÄòWhat do you think about research software engineering as a role and as a career path?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat are your thoughts on how open science might help the researchers worldwide?‚Äô and received some interesting responses:\n\n‚ÄúLooks interesting, since I have heard about it for the very first time in this talk at APAN58 meeting.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúIt is necessary for research software engineering management. I‚Äôve heard that the organisations usually do not have enough capacity for managing research software engineers. However, they need software consistently. So, the public sectors help with this.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an innovative way to share research, data and publications, etc.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúSo many students in the world have a very different situation in their social and life environment. For them, the internet and open science involving open access, open data, open software, and so on will help provide an education and research environment for equality.‚Äù\n\nIt was nice to see that my talk sparked curiosity in the audience and they promptly provided their feedback of what resonated with them. I also attended sessions on various topics including cybersecurity, high-performance computing & AI, agriculture and rural hybridization, network technologies, telemedicine and research collaborations. These sessions gave me more insights into the latest proceedings in the various fields of research and development in the Asia Pacific region.\nIn March 2025, I had the opportunity to speak at the Asia Pacific Advanced Network‚Äôs APAN59 meeting online remotely. My presentation was on the title ‚ÄòBuilding Bridges: Advancing Research Software Engineering and Open Science in Asia‚Äô. I gave my talk as part of the APAN‚Äôs Open and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG). Software being one of the pillars of Open Science, through this talk, I highlighted how paying attention towards developing and maintaining research software is directly linked to the principles of Open Science.\nLater in March 2025, I had the opportunity to present my talk titled ‚ÄòBuilding Bridges: Advancing Research Software Engineering and Open Science in Asia‚Äô at APAN59, online remotely again as part of the OSDWG discussion session. Software being one of the pillars of Open Science, through this talk, I highlighted how paying attention towards developing and maintaining research software is directly linked to the principles of Open Science.\nDuring my talk, I shared about my ongoing Research Study on the Research Software Engineering (RSEng) Landscape in Asia. I discussed the need of this study - due to the no/low representation of the community of researchers who code in the Asian region. This is demonstrated by the outcomes of an existing global survey by the Software Sustainability Institute, which completely lacks representation from Asia.\nSSI Survey Summary TableSource: Article by SSI: What do we know about RSEs?

The term ‚ÄòFree‚Äô denotes users‚Äô liberty to run, alter, and share the software, while ‚ÄòOpen Source‚Äô signifies that the software‚Äôs source code is available for users to inspect, modify, and contribute to its progress. FOSS promotes collaboration, transparency, and user empowerment. This frequently leads to the creation of more secure and sustainable software projects. Notable examples of FOSS include Linux, Blender, Chromium, Kubernetes, and Mozilla Firefox, among many more.\nüßë‚Äçüíªüåè What is FOSSASIA?\nFOSSASIA is an organisation developing Open Source software applications and Open Hardware together with a global community from its base in Asia. Their goal is to provide access to open technologies, science applications and knowledge that improve people‚Äôs lives. They enable people to adapt and change technology according to their own ideas and needs, and validate science and knowledge through an Open Access approach. It was established in 2009 by Hong Phuc Dang and Mario Behling. They organise and participate in conferences, meetups and code camps. The annual FOSSASIA Summit is one of the top tech events in Asia. FOSSASIA also runs a number of coding programs, such as Codeheat.\nThe 15th edition of FOSSASIA Summit was organised at True Digital Park, Bangkok, Thailand from 13th to 15th March 2025. It brought together individuals sharing talks on topics around Free and Open Source Software. The Summit had multiple parallel track sessions like talks, lightning talks, workshops, and more! There were booths by various organisations creating and/or using Free and Open Source Software. This was my first experience of attending FOSSASIA in-person in Thailand.\nüóìÔ∏è Day 1\nThe day started with a lot of fervour. Following the welcome session by Hong Phuc Dang, there were multiple parallel tracks of talks.

I learnt about a new tool - pgroll. It is an open-source command-line tool designed for PostgreSQL, ensuring that schema updates are applied safely, without locking the database, and enabling multiple schema versions to coexist. This ensures uninterrupted operation for client applications during migration, even when introducing breaking changes. The tool‚Äôs capability to automatically backfill columns and support instant rollbacks further enhances its reliability.\nLater that day, I came across the booth of Grafana Labs. As I spoke to Richard Hartmann, he shared about the useful features of Grafana Labs tools for creating reports, metrics, and graphs about the code being written.\nüóìÔ∏è Day 3\nI held a ‚ÄòMeet & Greet Spot‚Äô to speak to people about the field of Research Software Engineering, and discussed how it is a career path where one can combine their interest in implementing their research skills along with programming skills. I also shared about the past and the upcoming activities of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) Asia Association.

    "contents": "\nEpisode 5 bannerIntroduction\nIn the world of research software development, ensuring that code runs correctly and produces reliable results is crucial. However, software testing is often overlooked, particularly in academic settings where researchers may lack formal training in programming best practices. This challenge was a central theme in the recent discussion during episode 5 of our six-part series ‚ÄúEnabling Open Science Through Research Code‚Äù, where experts from diverse backgrounds shared their experiences and insights on making software testing accessible and effective.\nDuring the session, panellists emphasised that while research software development is often self-taught, adopting best practices such as software testing can improve both individual efficiency and collaboration. One of the mantras that continuously came up in the different episodes is that\n\nWe should be our own best collaborators first.\n\nEpisode 5 once again showed how good coding practices can benefit the coder as much as other contributors, collaborators, and users. This post summarises the discussion, highlighting practical tips for beginners and more advanced strategies for experienced developers.\nOur wonderful speakers included:\nAbhishek Dasgupta, Senior Research Software Engineer at Oxford Research Software Engineering group, University of Oxford, UK\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal, Research Software Engineer at Imperial College London, UK and co-founder of the RSE Asia Association\nSheena O‚ÄôConnell, Software developer, founder and trainer at Prelude, South Africa\nTips, Tools, and Practices for Novices\nIf you‚Äôre new to coding or research software development, software testing may seem like an advanced topic. However, as our panellists suggest, starting with simple practices can make a big difference in the reliability of your code.\n1. Start with Assertions\nAssertions are a lightweight way to check that your code behaves as expected. Sheena shared an example from her experience, explaining how beginners often overlook errors that could easily be caught by using assert statements in Python.\nAssertions act as built-in sanity checks and can help catch errors early before they lead to misleading research results.\n2. Use Smoke Testing\nSimply running your code from start to finish to ensure it doesn‚Äôt crash is an easy way to catch obvious issues. Sheena described this as a useful technique for those who may not yet have structured testing frameworks in place.\nAutomated tools like nbval can help validate Jupyter Notebooks by checking that expected outputs remain consistent, an approach that Abhishek recommended.\n3. Learn Basic Unit Testing\nUnit tests check individual functions or small sections of code. Abhishek stressed that even a simple test like assert 2 + 3 == 5 is a great first step.\nIn Python, pytest is a lightweight and easy-to-use testing framework, whereas in R, testthat provides a simple way to implement tests within research code.\n4. Keep Code Modular\nWriting functions instead of long scripts makes it easier to test individual components. As Sheena pointed out, ‚ÄúUntested code is brittle.‚Äù Structuring code into reusable functions makes adding tests more straightforward.\n5. Automate Where Possible\nUsing GitHub Actions or other Continuous Integration (CI) tools can automate testing whenever you update your code. Abhishek mentioned that CI is a great way to ensure code works across multiple platforms, which is particularly helpful when collaborating with researchers using different operating systems.\nFor R users, the {usethis} package simplifies the workflow setup, automating repetitive tasks (for both R packages as well as non-package projects), as suggested by Saranjeet. She also recommended using the {fusen} package for anyone new to R package development (and also for experienced developers while they are prototyping functions) as it involves writing the function as well as its documentation and unit tests in the same file, avoiding the risk of forgetting crucial steps.\nImage Credits:Torsten Zelger\nApproaches to Software Testing for Experienced Developers\nFor those already familiar with software development, a more structured approach to testing can improve reproducibility and collaboration. The panellists discussed key strategies for advanced users, including:\n1. Different Types of Testing\nUnit Testing: Ensures small, isolated parts of the code work as expected.\nIntegration Testing: Checks if different parts of the system function correctly together. Abhishek highlighted the importance of this, noting that end-to-end validation is often overlooked in research projects.\nRegression Testing: Ensures new changes don‚Äôt break existing functionality, an approach Sheena described as essential for long-term code maintenance.\nProperty-Based Testing: Uses tools like hypothesis in Python to test code with a range of inputs, uncovering unexpected behaviours. Abhishek noted this as particularly useful for numerical research software.\n2. Version Control and CI/CD\nGit and GitHub/GitLab: Version control helps track changes, making it easier to debug issues. Sheena emphasised that ‚Äúresearchers who don‚Äôt use version control end up with folders full of files like final_version_revised_final_final.py, which is a nightmare to maintain.‚Äù\nContinuous Integration (CI): Running tests automatically on GitHub ensures all code changes are validated before being merged. Abhishek explained that setting up CI allows researchers to avoid relying on manual testing across different machines.\n3. Cross-Platform Testing\nResearchers often work across different operating systems. Automating tests in cloud environments ensures compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nTools like tox or nox (Python) allow testing across multiple versions of a language. Abhishek highlighted that CI workflows, once set up, eliminate the need to manually ask colleagues to test code on different platforms.\n4. Automating Data Validations\nData quality is critical in research. Sheena introduced pandera in Python, a tool that helps verify data integrity and data schemas before analysis.\nStatistical validation using libraries like scipy.stats can confirm that distributions match expected properties, an approach recommended for data-intensive projects.\n5. Balancing Testing with Research Deadlines\nWriting tests may seem like extra work, but it prevents time-consuming debugging later. Abhishek acknowledged that ‚Äúgetting 100% test coverage is impractical for most research projects, but basic integration tests should be a minimum.‚Äù\nUsing automated tools like R‚Äôs targets package helps manage computational workflows efficiently, only re-running necessary parts of the code. Saranjeet recommended this as a time-saving approach for researchers handling large datasets.\nConclusion\nSoftware testing is not just for professional developers‚Äîit is an essential practice for research reproducibility and collaboration. While beginners can start with simple assertions and unit tests, advanced users can implement continuous integration, property-based testing, and automated data validation to ensure code reliability.\nAs Anelda concluded,\n\nTesting is not just about making research more open; it‚Äôs about being your own best > collaborator.\n\nBy integrating these testing strategies into research software development, we can move toward a more open, transparent, and reliable scientific ecosystem.\nüì¢ Explore More:\nAccess our Resource Sheet, which contains numerous valuable resources shared by the panellists, facilitators, and participants.\nView the session recording on YouTube.\nThe first draft of this blog post was created with ChatGPT from the edited video transcript.\nLooking Ahead\nThe next episode in the series, ‚ÄúResearch Software Funding‚Äù will take place on March 20, 2025, at 08:30 UTC.

    "contents": "\nEpisode 4 bannerImagine you‚Äôve spent months crafting a complex research software tool, refining algorithms, and running countless simulations. It works brilliantly‚Äîbut then, six months later, you revisit the code and‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre lost. Sounds familiar? You‚Äôre not alone. Experts shared their experiences and strategies for writing good documentation in the fourth episode of the Research Software Community Conversations Series titled Enabling Open Science through Research Code. Here‚Äôs what we learned from our participants and insightful panellists:\nJenny Wong - Product Manager @ 2i2c (UK/US)\nJoel Nitta - Associate Professor @ Chiba University (Japan)\nMthetho Sovara - Centre for High-Performance Computing (CHPC), National Integrated Cyberinfrastructure System (NICIS) CSIR (South Africa)\nüìå Why Documentation is Essential\nüöÄ Boosts Reproducibility: Research software often accompanies papers, but results can be difficult to replicate without documentation. As Jenny pointed out, in fluid dynamics research, well-documented simulation codes gained more adoption than poorly documented alternatives.\nü§ù Facilitates Collaboration: Well-documented projects attract more contributors and streamline knowledge transfer. Joel shared his experience in the rOpenSci community, where clear documentation allowed him to take over and improve an existing R package without needing direct input from the original creator.\n‚è≥ Enhances Longevity: Code without documentation quickly becomes unusable‚Äîeven by its original authors! Mthetho described how well-documented software in weather forecasting led to unexpected collaborations with the South African Weather Service and Ethiopian researchers.\nüîì Promotes Open Science: Accessible research software fosters innovation and inclusion worldwide. Jenny emphasised that accessible documentation enables wider adoption of tools, making scientific computing more democratic.\nüî• Common Challenges & Solutions\n‚è∞ Time Constraints ‚Üí Write minimal but clear documentation as you code. Joel suggested that legible code, such as meaningful variable names instead of ‚Äúx‚Äù or ‚Äúdat‚Äù, is itself a form of documentation that is even better than comments.\nüß© Lack of Standardisation ‚Üí Use templates and structured frameworks. Mthetho mentioned that clear, structured guides helped non-computational scientists successfully use OpenFOAM in unexpected fields like environmental science.\nüéØ Technical vs.¬†User Documentation ‚Üí Engage users in documentation efforts for clarity. Jenny highlighted the role of community-driven documentation efforts, such as hackathons, to improve usability.\nüõ† Best Practices for Better Documentation\n‚úçÔ∏è 1. Write as You Code\nWaiting until the end leads to missing details. Add inline comments and README files while developing. Joel emphasised that tools like RMarkdown (and its successor, Quarto) can be used for literate programming‚Äîthereby ensuring that the results of code are automatically generated alongside their description.\nüîÑ 2. Differentiate Documentation Types\n‚úî User-facing documentation: How to install, use, and troubleshoot.\n‚úî Developer-facing documentation: Comments, API references, contribution guides.\nüìö 3. Use the Right Tools\nüìÑ Markdown & Jupyter Notebooks ‚Äì Combine narrative and code.\nüìù Quarto & R Markdown ‚Äì For structured research outputs.\nüìò Sphinx & MIST ‚Äì Python-based documentation frameworks.\nüåê GitHub Wikis & Pages ‚Äì Host documentation openly.\nü§ñ AI-based tools (e.g., Cursor, Copilot) ‚Äì Assist with documentation (but always review!).\nü§ù 4. Community & Collaboration Matter\nüí° Participate in documentation hackathons. Jenny shared how Project Pythia‚Äôs hackathons provided a structured way to improve documentation in geospatial science. üåç Join communities like Project Pythia, The Carpentries, and Write the Docs.\nüí∞ 5. Advocate for Funding & Policy Support\nüì¢ Push for documentation funding in grant proposals.\nüèõ Engage with funders to integrate documentation into open science policies.\nüöÄ Future of Documentation: AI & Automation\nü§ñ Automated Documentation: AI tools generate initial drafts, saving researchers time. However, while helpful, AI-assisted documentation should always be reviewed for accuracy.\nüåç AI for Translation: Helps make documentation accessible in multiple languages, fostering global inclusivity. Anelda highlighted how AI tools might support research documentation in multilingual communities in the future. For now, we still need a human-in-the-loop translator for translation efforts. Especially for low-resourced languages.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Caution Needed: AI-generated content must be reviewed for accuracy and ethical considerations. Jenny raised concerns about biases in AI and the environmental impact of large-scale machine learning models.\nüéØ Final Thoughts: Make Documentation a Priority\nGreat research code deserves great documentation. It makes work reproducible, fosters collaboration, and ensures that software remains usable long after its creator has moved on. By embracing best practices and community support, we can all contribute to a culture where documentation is seen not as a burden‚Äîbut as a fundamental part of open science.\nüì¢ Explore More:\nAccess our Resource Sheet, which contains numerous valuable resources shared by the panellists, facilitators, and participants.\nView the session recording on YouTube.\nThe first draft of this blog post was created with ChatGPT from the edited video transcript.\nLooking Ahead\nThe next episode in the series, ‚ÄúTesting Research Code‚Äù will take place on February 20, 2025, at 08:30 UTC.

    "contents": "\nEpisode 3 bannerIn December 2024, we hosted episode four of our six-part series on Enabling Opening Science through Research Code. This time, we focused on openly sharing research code. The conversation provided invaluable insights into best practices, challenges, and the impact of open source in research. Whether you are a researcher, software developer, or just getting started, here are the key takeaways from this inspiring discussion.\nWhy Open Research Code Matters\nResearch software plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. Making it openly accessible enhances transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration. The discussion highlighted several reasons why open code can be beneficial to those who develop it as well as the broader research community:\nReproducibility & Credibility: When researchers share their code, others can validate and build upon it, ensuring scientific integrity.\nCollaboration & Community Growth: Open software enables researchers and developers worldwide to work together, improving tools and methodologies.\nIncreased Citations & Impact: Studies with accessible code tend to receive more citations, increasing the visibility and influence of the research.\nFunding & Institutional Support: Many funding agencies now require researchers to share code and data as part of open science initiatives.\nChallenges and How to Overcome Them\nWhile making code open has clear benefits, it comes with its own set of challenges. Speakers shared personal experiences and solutions to common obstacles:\nFear of Criticism: Many researchers worry that sharing their code may invite scrutiny. However, constructive feedback leads to improved code quality.\nMaintaining Code Over Time: Researchers often move on to new projects and cannot maintain old code. One solution is to create a community around a project, inviting contributors to help maintain and improve it.\nData Privacy & Intellectual Property: Researchers must anonymise datasets or create synthetic versions that simulate actual data while maintaining confidentiality when dealing with sensitive data.\nDocumentation & Reusability: A well-documented project is far more valuable to others. Providing README files, usage instructions, and licensing information makes it easier for others to use and contribute.\nWe talk more about documentation in Episode 4!\n\nBest Practices for Sharing Research Code\nTo make code truly open and useful, researchers can consider the following best practices:\nUse Version Control Platforms: Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket facilitate collaboration, version tracking, and code sharing.\nChoose an Appropriate License: Open source licenses like MIT, Apache 2.0, and GPL define how others can use and modify the code.\nProvide Clear Documentation: A README file explaining installation, usage, dependencies, and citation details makes the code accessible to others.\nInclude Citation Information: Using a CITATION.cff file ensures that researchers get credit for their work when their code is used in publications.\nUse Containerisation for Reproducibility: Tools like Docker and GitHub Code Spaces help ensure that code runs the same way on different machines.\nLeverage Community Support: Engaging with communities like Research Software Engineering (RSE) groups, The Carpentries, and others provides learning opportunities and networking.\nDiverse Perspectives on Open Science\nThe discussion brought together speakers from various backgrounds, including bioinformatics, linguistics, software engineering, and illustration. Their stories emphasised that open science is not just for software developers but also for researchers and creatives working in different fields.\nAdeyinka Oresanya, a software developer at CHAOSS in Nigeria\nChioma Onyido, a bioinformatician from Nigeria, shared how Bioconductor, an open-source project for bioinformatics, has been instrumental in her work.\nMars Lee, a technical illustrator, highlighted the importance of visual documentation to make open source more accessible.\nKate Huddlestone, a linguist at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, shared how open-source tools enabled her to work with sign language data, significantly advancing her research.\nJuan Pablo, a senior program manager at GitHub, discussed how GitHub provides tools like citation files and ORCID integration to make research software more discoverable and citable.\nFinal Advice for Researchers Interested in Open Code\nEach speaker shared a key piece of advice for those looking to engage in open research software:\nJoin a Community: Engaging with open-source and research communities provides learning and collaboration opportunities.\nTake Small Steps: Even minimal documentation, a simple README, or choosing a license makes a big difference.\nLeverage Available Resources: Many educational institutions provide free access to GitHub tools and training programs.\nDon‚Äôt Fear Making Mistakes: Sharing imperfect code is better than keeping it inaccessible. The community will help improve it.\nConclusion\nOpening research code benefits both individual researchers and the broader scientific community. By embracing best practices and leveraging community support, researchers can enhance collaboration, improve research reproducibility, and increase the impact of their work. Whether you are just starting or looking to improve your open science practices, remember that engagement, documentation, and a willingness to share and learn are the keys to success.\nThe first draft of this blog post was created with ChatGPT from the edited video transcript.\nLooking Ahead\nThe next episode in the series, ‚ÄúDocumentation for Research Code‚Äù will take place on January 23, 2025, at 08:30 UTC.

Episode 2, titled ‚ÄúEnabling Reproducibility Through Research Code,‚Äù took place on November 14, 2024, bringing together a diverse group of participants and experts to discuss a cornerstone of open science‚Äîreproducibility. A valuable open educational resource related to this topic, which the meetup was based on, is available from CodeRefinery.\nReproduciblility through research codeThe Turing Way Community. This illustration is created by Scriberia with The Turing Way community, used under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807\nConnecting Researchers Who Code\nA key goal of this series is to connect researchers who code, especially those in Asia and Africa, with peers worldwide to foster collaboration and support. As Anelda van der Walt (RSSE Africa) explained:\n‚ÄúThere are so many researchers who code, but they‚Äôre often isolated and don‚Äôt have communities to share tools, best practices, or even just to vent about the challenges. We hope this series can be the starting point for those conversations.‚Äù\nWe welcomed participants from various disciplines, including health-related fields, law, linguistics, and bioinformatics. The audience represented a mix of coding-heavy researchers (spending over 50% of their day coding), less frequent coders, and those just beginning their coding journey.\nMeet the Panel\nEpisode 2 featured a diverse panel of experts who brought their unique perspectives on enabling reproducibility:\nKozo Nishida: Project Researcher, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan\nPeter van Heusden: Bioinformatician, South African National Bioinformatics Institute/University of the Western Cape, South Africa\nRadovan Bast: Research Software Engineer, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, and managing the CodeRefinery project.\nPanel Discussion: Tips for Enabling Reproducibility\nReproducibility, in its simplest terms, is about ensuring that research findings can be replicated and validated. Without reproducibility, there‚Äôs no way to confirm the reliability of scientific results.\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal, one of the session facilitators from RSE Asia, captured this sentiment perfectly when she said:\n‚ÄúBe your own best collaborator.‚Äù\nThis idea resonated with all the panellists, who emphasised the importance of documenting workflows and code in a way that‚Äôs accessible and understandable‚Äînot just for others, but for your future self.\nRadovan Bast added to this perspective, explaining:\n‚ÄúThe person you will collaborate with most within your academic career is your past and future self. We should be kind to our future selves!‚Äù\nWhether six months or years down the line, thorough documentation and explanation of your work ensures you‚Äîor anyone else‚Äîcan reproduce the results.\nKozo Nishida shared a practical example from metabolomics research, underlining the challenges of reproducibility in quantifying mass spectrometry data. He explained that creating annotations for mass spec peaks often requires manual tweaks and detailed adjustments. Without thorough documentation and clear steps, reproducing metabolomics quantifications becomes nearly impossible.\nPeter van Heusden reflected on his experiences entering the field of pathogen bioinformatics. He noted that many research papers described methodologies but often omitted critical details, highlighting the importance of reproducibility. He emphasised:\n‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not in code, it‚Äôs not really reproducible.‚Äù\nFor Peter, reproducibility means translating what has been done manually into code, ensuring that workflows are transparent and repeatable.\nRadovan Bast pointed out that reproducibility encompasses many elements‚Äîdata, scripts, dependencies, environments, workflows, and more. He acknowledged that achieving perfect reproducibility can be daunting and advised:\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let perfect be the enemy of good enough.‚Äù\nRadovan reminded the audience that reproducibility doesn‚Äôt need to be flawless to be valuable. He emphasised the importance of sharing work in a reusable way to avoid reinventing the wheel or wasting time.\nPractical Tips for Ensuring Reproducibility\nThe session provided many actionable tips to help researchers make their work more reproducible. These included advice on file types, documentation tools, and simple practices like running code on a different computer to ensure it works across environments.\nAs with all sessions in the series, a comprehensive resource sheet summarising these tips is available here.\nThe Importance of Community in Reproducibility\nThe panel stressed how reproducibility benefits not just individual researchers but entire research communities:\nRadovan Bast stressed that limited time and resources make it essential to ‚Äústand on the shoulders of others‚Äù by building on existing tools and workflows rather than starting from scratch every time. However, he cautioned that when using others‚Äô code, researchers should always check the license to ensure they have permission to use it and later share their changes.\nPeter van Heusden highlighted the importance of structured approaches. Starting projects with standardised templates not only ensures consistency but also makes it easier to reproduce and reuse workflows.\nKozo Nishida added that reproducible code enables others to build upon your work, improving entire fields of research. He emphasised the importance of joining communities to share tools, collaborate, and foster reproducibility collectively.\nLicensing and Assisted Coding\nWhen using code found online, it‚Äôs crucial to respect the provided license and credit the author.\nAssisted coding with AI, however, raises unresolved questions about licensing and authorship. The panel noted that clearer guidelines from legal experts are needed as this area continues to evolve. It will be interesting to see how these tools and spaces adapt to address these challenges.\nLooking Ahead\nThe next episode in the series, ‚ÄúOpening Up Your Code,‚Äù will take place on December 12, 2024, at 08:30 UTC. Be sure to register here and join the conversation!\nFor those who missed Episode 2, a resources sheet with tips and the session recording is available.

The topic for the first episode was ‚ÄòConversations with Researchers Who Code‚Äô focusing on the pivotal role of research software in enabling open science. The event was hosted by RSSE Africa and the RSE Asia Association. It aimed to bring together researchers from various disciplines to share their experiences of coding, collaboration, and the challenges they face as they navigate the world of open science. This episode was a part of the celebration for International Research Software Engineer (RSE) Day, bringing attention to the growing importance of RSEs in research.\nSession Overview\nThe session kicked off with facilitators Anelda van der Walt and Saranjeet Kaur welcoming participants and introducing the co-facilitators Jyoti Bhogal and Mireille Grobbelaar. This diverse team set the stage for a lively discussion with four distinguished speakers: Dr.¬†Biandri Joubert, Dr.¬†Gaurav Bhalerao, Mahmoud Abdelrazek, and Prasad Sutar. The session had around 30 participants from all across the world.\nIntroductions & Open Science Insights\nAfter a warm welcome, the conversation shifted to the core topic: open science and the importance of research software and systems as described in the UNESCO Open Science Recommendations. The facilitators invited the speakers to share their academic backgrounds, work experiences, and current roles, giving the audience a sense of the various pathways that lead them into the world of research software coding.\nSome of the key questions posed to the speakers included:\nWhat did you study, and where?\nDo you have postgraduate qualifications?\nWhat is your current role, and how does coding feature in your work?\nThis introduction provided a backdrop to understand how the speakers‚Äô careers evolved, and how their coding skills were developed to support their research or that of others at the organisation where they work.\nPanel Discussion: The Life of a Researcher Who Codes\nThe heart of the session was a panel discussion where the speakers delved deeper into the realities of research coding. Some highlights from the discussion include:\nDr.¬†Gaurav Bhalerao explained how coding forms an integral part of his day-to-day activities, particularly in structuring large datasets for neuroscience research. He also shared the challenges of balancing coding with research responsibilities.\nMahmoud Abdelrazek talked about his work in geospatial analysis and how his team collaborates on coding projects. He highlighted the collaborative nature of his work, where coding is not only a personal skill but also a shared responsibility within his research group.\nDr.¬†Biandri Joubert touched on the challenges of being the sole programmer in her group and how she overcomes the feeling of isolation by participating in coding communities and seeking support from platforms like the Carpentries.\nPrasad Sutar discussed his experience with developing software that is used by others and the importance of ensuring that his coding practices align with both the research objectives and software quality standards.\nThe panel also explored whether all researchers should learn to code. They agreed that even if a researcher doesn‚Äôt need to code regularly, learning basic coding concepts is valuable. This foundational knowledge enables researchers to read and understand code at a high level, helping them grasp the algorithms or logic applied to address specific problem statements. A valuable analogy, comparing coding to medical training was suggested during the meetup. Just as it‚Äôs beneficial for everyone to learn basic first-aid, it‚Äôs useful for researchers to grasp fundamental coding concepts. Some may advance to become paramedics, equivalent to those using coding more regularly, while a few specialize deeply - similar to neurosurgeons or expert programmers. What are your thoughts? Should coding become a core skill for all researchers, or is it more practical to foster collaboration with coding specialists when needed?\nThe panel also explored topics like the amount of time spent coding, the collaborative nature of research software projects, and the availability of support and training for researchers.\nLearning and Community Support\nAn essential part of the discussion revolved around the resources and communities that help researchers improve their coding skills. Dr.¬†Gaurav Bhalerao recommended resources such as Carpentries lessons and online coding tutorials like p5.js for those starting out. The speakers emphasized the importance of continuous learning and staying connected with the global community through platforms like RLadies, Quarto, and others. To know about more resources please see the section Resources and Links.\nQ&A and Wrap-Up\nThe session concluded with a Q&A where participants posed questions about the pain points of learning to code, transitioning into a coding role from other fields, and how to stay updated with coding trends while maintaining research quality. One insightful comment came from Dr.¬†Biandri Joubert, who emphasized that code that runs doesn‚Äôt always mean it‚Äôs correct, highlighting the critical need for combining coding skills with sound statistical knowledge.\nThe facilitators wrapped up the event by sharing resources from partners, including RSSE Africa, RSE Asia, AREN, and ReSA, all of which provide platforms for collaboration, learning, and advocacy for the Research Software Engineering community.\nResources and Links\nTo access the wealth of resources shared in the session, visit our collection at Zenodo.\nFor those who missed this enlightening conversation, a recording of Episode 1 is available on the RSSE Africa website.

I experienced a diverse lineup, including keynotes, technical talks, hands-on workshops, lightning talks, poster sessions, and open forums (birds of feather (BoF) sessions). Sponsor stalls added to the excitement, and the open spaces allowed for spontaneous interactions, adding to the conference‚Äôs lively atmosphere. Celebrating its 15th anniversary this year, PyCon India 2024 marked my second time attending, following my first experience at PyCon India 2023 in Hyderabad.\nLightning Talks\nI had the opportunity to present a Lightning Talk titled ‚ÄúAccelerating India‚Äôs Open Science Journey with Python.‚Äù In my session, I introduced the audience to the concept of open science, highlighting its importance for India, exploring its four foundational pillars, and demonstrating how Python plays a vital role in advancing open science efforts. The talk was well-received, and you can view the slides on Zenodo.\nMy Lightning TalkClick below to view video:\n\n\nKeynotes\nThe conference featured four insightful keynotes:\nKovid Goyal presented ‚ÄúMaking Python Programs Fast,‚Äù where he shared in-depth techniques to optimize Python performance using C language.\nUsha Rengaraju spoke on ‚ÄúAI for Autism,‚Äù shedding light on neurodiversity and the potential of AI in autism research.\nMars Bar Lee explored ‚ÄúHow Open-Source Opened My Opportunities,‚Äù highlighting how contributions to open-source projects can extend beyond code, such as her technical illustrations for NumPy.\nJames Powell delivered a creative talk, ‚ÄúHow Many Oranges?‚Äù\nEach keynote brought valuable perspectives, and Mars Bar Lee‚Äôs emphasis on non-code contributions was particularly interesting. I got to meet Mars in-person, after having met online previously for a workshop on importance of alt text with images for improving digital accessibility.\nL-R: Mars, Unicorn, me, and NumPy comicsWorkshops\nThe first day had 3-hour workshops going on in three tracks. I attended two immersive workshops:\nChat with Tables: Developing Q&A system on Tabular data using Code Generative LLMs by Abhijeet Kumar\nAbhijeet conducted a workshop about Generative AI powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that are revolutionizing text, image, and video generation, as well as coding through enterprise solutions like GitHub Copilot, Google‚Äôs Gemini Code Assist, IBM‚Äôs Watsonx, and Amazon‚Äôs Q Developer. Abhijeet‚Äôs workshop focused on leveraging code-generating LLMs to enable non-technical users to generate Python code by using natural language queries, bridging the gap for business users who lack programming skills but need quick data insights. This solution is valuable for business users who often require ad-hoc analysis of tabular data but rely heavily on data teams. Abhijeet demonstrated a workflow to query tabular data, generate insights from CSVs, and enhance natural language querying (NLQ) through techniques like few-shot prompting, pruning, and validation. Additionally, the session included setting up a streamlined process for building Q&A systems for tabular data and creating a Streamlit app, making data insights more accessible to non-technical analysts.\nFrom Zero to Backend Hero: Creating Full-Featured Apps with FastAPI by Vivek Keshore\nVivek started by interacting with the audience to gather basic information like what an API is, the different types of APIs, and the various types of calls. Vivek discussed the benefits of using FastAPI. He went on to discuss database design. Vivek discussed about implementation of Pydantic models and the development of user management APIs.\nPyLadies Luncheon\nThe PyLadies Luncheon was a personal highlight during the conference. Women attendees gathered to share their experiences, openly discussing the challenges they face related to diversity and inclusivity in their workplaces and how they‚Äôve overcome these obstacles over time. Hearing these stories and learning about the resilience and strategies of others was truly inspiring and energizing for me.\nSponsor Stalls\nThe conference featured several sponsor stalls, and one that stood out to me was the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organization for retail payments and settlement systems in India. I was intrigued to learn how their payments ecosystem is entirely open-source, with data storage managed on-premises instead of on Cloud platforms. Additionally, they introduced me to UPI payments that can be made via phone call or SMS, allowing transactions without an internet connection.\nDevSprints\nThe DevSprint was a one-day event featuring around 20 different projects. The day began with core contributors providing an overview of their respective projects, allowing participants to choose any project they were interested in contributing to. Among the various projects, I found myself particularly drawn to Django and NumPy.\nI opted to join the NumPy DevSprint, facilitated by technical illustrator Mars Bar Lee and NumPy core contributor Sebastian Berg. They introduced all the contributors to the NumPy project, outlining various ways to engage with the community through community calls, mailing lists, and comics, as well as how to contribute effectively. If you‚Äôre interested in contributing to NumPy, you can refer to the Contributing Guidelines for more information.\nI had the opportunity to attend an open session led by Saptak S., where participants discussed the nuances of digital accessibility, particularly in website development. The discussion covered essential points such as ensuring adequate contrast between text and background colors, structuring headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) correctly, and guidelines for including appropriate details in the alt text for images. I discovered several valuable online resources to check and test webpage accessibility, including:\nA11y Project: A checklist for assessing accessibility levels.\naxe DevTools: A tool that evaluates whether a website complies with accessibility guidelines, available as an extension for Chrome, Firefox, and MS Edge browsers.\nWAVE: A tool that highlights areas of a website that are well or poorly designed regarding accessibility. WAVE also offers extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and MS Edge browsers.\nThe Button Cheat Sheet: A resource to determine if buttons on a website‚Äôs UI are designed effectively.\nThe WebAIM Million: The 2024 report on the accessibility of the top 1,000,000 home pages.\nWe discussed key considerations for developers when creating digitally accessible web pages. For instance, keyboard navigation is crucial for individuals with visual impairments or otherwise while working with a document by using only the keyboard, necessitating a logical heading structure (e.g., H1 followed by H2, and so on). It‚Äôs important to avoid jumping from say, H1 to H4, as this can confuse users.\nIn terms of coding practices, developers should specify the document language by adding the ‚Äòlang‚Äô attribute. This helps indicate which programming language is being used for different sections of the website. Additionally, tools like JAWS provide voice assistance to help developers ensure accessibility standards are met.\nDuring Continuous Integration (CI), it‚Äôs essential for developers to incorporate these accessibility guidelines into their workflows.\nSaptak also recommended several excellent learning resources, such as Adrian Roselli‚Äôs articles on accessibility issues, conference talks from experts in digital accessibility, and a helpful site for determining whether to use a carousel post: Should I Use a Carousel?\nConclusion\nThe PyCon India 2024 concluded with the DevSprints, marking an incredibly immersive learning experience for me. The Closing Ceremony featured two beat-box artists who entertained us, adding a refreshing twist to the event. I also had the pleasure of meeting Tanvi Agarwal, a digital illustrator who provides live transcription of talks, which I found truly inspiring. A big thank you to the entire PyCon India volunteer organizing team for once again delivering a fantastic conference!\nGet In Touch:\nEmail: bhogaljyoti1@gmail.comLinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/jyoti-bhogalGitHub: https://github.com/jyoti-bhogalWebsite: https://jyoti-bhogal.github.io/about-me/index.html\n\n\n\n",

The significance of this lies in the fact that NRENs have not traditionally been significantly involved in supporting RSE groups in other regions.\nAs I delved deeper into this topic, I learned that NRENs are specialised internet service providers designed to cater to the needs of research and education sectors in a particular region or country. These networks typically feature high-speed backbone connectivity and may provide dedicated channels for individual research initiatives. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) is the international partnership of the NRENs that provides both domestic and international high-speed network connectivity.\nRSE Asia at APAN\nMy interest in this topic grew during my participation in the Society of RSE pilot mentoring programme, where my mentor, Michelle Barker, introduced me to APAN. As a result, I attended the 53rd APAN meeting (APAN53), which was held virtually from March 7th to 11th, 2022.\nAt APAN53, I contributed to a panel discussion entitled ‚ÄúAccelerating the paradigm shift towards Open Science and Data Sharing in pandemic times and beyond‚Äù and presented the advancements of the RSE Asia Association. Additionally, I shared the narratives from RSE Asia Association at the workshop session titled ‚ÄúGrowing research software initiatives and communities in the Asia Pacific.‚Äù\nHowever, it was at the 55th Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN55) meeting in Kathmandu, Nepal, where I had the opportunity to attend as a APAN55 Fellow, that I gained more knowledge about the NRENs in Asia. The Nepal NREN played an essential role in organising and hosting the event this year, and similarly, the Lanka Education and Research Network (LEARN), the Sri Lankan NREN, will be hosting and organising the upcoming APAN56 meeting.\nNational Research and Education Networks in Asia\nAfghanistan: Afghanistan NREN (AfgREN)\nBangladesh: Bangladesh NREN (BdREN)\nChina: China Science and Technology Network (CSTNET)\nChina: China Education and Research Network (CERNET)\nHong Kong: Hong Kong Academic and Research Network (HARNET)\nIndia: Education and Research Network of India (ERNET)\nIndia: National Knowledge Network (NKN) India\nIndonesia: Indonesia Research and Education Network (IdREN)\nJapan: Science Information Network (SINET) Japan\nKorea: Korea Advanced Research Network (KOREN)\nKorea: Korea Research Environment Open Network (KREONET)\nMalaysia: Malaysian Research and Education Network (MyREN)\nNepal: Nepal Research and Education Network (NREN)\nPakistan: Pakistan Education and Research Network (PERN)\nPhilippines: Philippine Research , Education and Government Information Network (PREGINET)\nSingapore: Singapore Advanced Research and Education Network (SingAREN)\nSri Lanka: Lanka Education and Research Network (LEARN)\nTaiwan: Taiwan Advanced Research and Education Network (TWAREN)\nThailand: Thailand Education and Research Network (UniNet)\nVietnam: Vietnam Research and Education Network (VinaREN)\nAt APAN55, I presented the ‚ÄúRSE Asia Association: Journey and Future Plans‚Äù at the ‚ÄúOpen and Sharing Data Working Group (OSDWG): Asia Pacific Open-Sharing Data and NRENs Open Science‚Äù session. Additionally, to promote the RSE Asia Association, I shared swag (sponsored by the Open Life Science programme). During the session, I also organised an activity in which participants were asked to share their ideas on Research Software Engineering (RSEng) as a career path and how open science could benefit researchers globally. I noticed several parallels between the duties and expertise of the staff at NRENs who develop research software infrastructure and those of RSEs while interacting with the attendees.\nIn a Twitter thread, I compiled responses from APAN55 participants regarding their opinions on RSEng as a profession and a career path. One person from Malaysia responded, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs an interesting path to choose especially for people who like to do research and also want to develop software‚Äù. An attendee from Nepal commented, ‚ÄúFor me it‚Äôs a domain of software engineering‚Äù, while someone from South Korea observed that software has a significant impact in various domains. They stated that with software being integrated into almost every domain, there is a need for research to enhance its capabilities. Another participant from Nepal mentioned that they believed the role of RSEng to be important and its significance had grown over time. They further stated that the particular requirements of researchers could only be met by specialised software engineers who develop an understanding of the research ecosystem, have knowledge of existing solutions, and are capable of bridging any gaps that may exist. Quoting an attendee from India, ‚ÄúIndeed there could be a wonderful career for a software engineer in academia. If they get a rich experience over technology it can help the researchers to facilitate their theory into a workable project or product. Software Engineering could be a backbone where concepts can be transformed into productive algorithms and results can be automated. It can also set up a process path for executing a project. Problem statements can be set up by a software engineer for a group of students and academics.‚Äù\n\n(From left to right and top to bottom) My presentation about the RSE Asia Association, RSE Asia Association swags, Twitter thread about the activity. Image credit: Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal\nCall to Action\nIn general, I have observed that RSEng is gaining recognition in broader conversations about Open Science, Open Source, etc. However, there seems to be a lack of direct attention towards this topic in the Asian region, as mentioned in a report on ‚ÄúExpanding the mapping of the global research software community.‚Äù To address this gap, I have been promoting awareness and leading the efforts to focus on RSEng within the APAN network (at APAN53 and APAN55). Given the breadth of the APAN network and NRENs in Asia, they could serve as a great hub for the research software community in the region. If you have any suggestions on how we can leverage NRENs to foster the growth of the RSEng community in Asia, please feel free to get in touch. We might be able to submit a panel discussion on this topic at APAN56! Also feel free to share any ideas for other relevant conferences in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAcknowledgements:\nThis blog post has benefitted from the suggestions and feedback by Michelle Barker and Paula Andrea Martinez.\nLearn More About Us\nFor more information and to join upcoming events, visit:\nRSE Asia\nWebsite: https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/\nFor the latest news, events, activities, and opportunities, follow us on our LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/company/rse-asia-association/)\nTo join the RSE Asia community, please fill out our short Community Membership Form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XSxDaTJzcNyGeDYXyJNVg1TDCo7un18PLFNiK6\\_jL2g/edit)\n\n\n\n",

My mentor for the program was Malvika Sharan. There are several incidents when people want to contribute in a community activity, but the community does not have a well-defined path that will help a new person contribute. This motivated me to work on building pathways for new members to join the RSE Asia Association.\r\nThe Backstory\r\nThe inception of RSE Asia Association goes back to September 2021, when our idea of starting it got the support of the experts from the OLS-4 cohort. Back then we started off with a basic logo. We had set up the entire digital structure need to run the community. During cohort 5, we updated the logo.\r\nMilestones the RSE Asia Association Crossed During OLS-5\r\nLet‚Äôs have a look at the milestones in the journey that RSE Asia Association went through while OLS-5.\r\nMilestone 1\r\nThe selection into OLS-5 itself was a milestone. Following which, we started discussions around how to get our Association registered.\r\nWe wanted to register ourselves as an NGO. With the guidance from my mentor Malvika, I read several articles. I found out about the different types of NGOs that function here in India. After careful reading, understanding and discussions with my mentor, we finalized which type of NGO would be best for us to register as. At the moment, the registration is a work in progress.\r\nMilestone 2\r\nWhen it comes to community work, we had identified that a lot of people are enthusiastic about participating in community work, however many communities face an issue when it comes to a smooth process for people to join them. Hence, we decided to define clear pathways for people to join us, to contribute/learn for a specific time duration.\r\nMilestone 3\r\nThe RSE Asia Association also got listed as an ‚ÄòObserver Association‚Äô at the International Council of RSE Associations.\r\nMilestone 4\r\nOn 8th July 2022, we conducted a workshop, where Isabela Presedo-Floyd and Mars Lee very graciously accepted our invitation to share their knowledge of how alt-texts are written. It was indeed a very exciting and engaging event where people did hands-on work!\r\nNext steps\r\nJyoti would continue with the formalities of getting the association registered legally. Saranjeet and Jyoti are planning to conduct more and more exciting events and workshops.\r\nStaying connected\r\nCome have a look at our activities!\r\nWe are absolutely active on Twitter. We send out all our updates, reminders and links to various forms via our twitter handle which is @RSE_Asia. Do check out our twitter page, look at our past and upcoming events, DM us to speak your thoughts!\r\nSpecial mentions and acknowledgements\r\nWe feel very grateful to the OLS team for giving us this chance to grow our RSE Asia Association!\r\nWe are extremely thankful to be a part of such a wonderful and supportive community that OLS is!\r\nAnd our contact details are shown herewith. You can get in touch with us via our twitter handle, our email address.\r\nYou can also visit our website, YouTube channel or our GitHub page.\r\nThank you!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
