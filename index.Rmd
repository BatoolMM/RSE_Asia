We will be launching the RSE Asia Association on Thursday, 14th October 2021. This day holds special significance as it is being celebrated as the [International RSE Day](https://researchsoftware.org/council/intl-rse-day.html), for the first time!
At the launch event we will be conducting activities for contributing to [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) too. We hope to have you join us at the launch event.
