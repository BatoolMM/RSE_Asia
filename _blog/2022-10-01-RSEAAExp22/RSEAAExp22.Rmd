## What is the RSEAA Unconference?

An unconference is a conference where all participants engage in oactive discussion rather than just listening to the speaker's talk.

The RSEAA unconference had a mixed style of regular conference and unconference.
The regular style part had three keynote and a panel discussion.
Recordings of the keynotes and panel discussion are available on YouTube.
